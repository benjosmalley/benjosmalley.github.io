I'm currently a student at Becker College enrolled in Interactive Media Design with a concentration of Video Game Design.
Prior to college, I was on the FIRST Robotics team, specifically on the animation team, for four years. The animation team was tasked with creating a Safety Animation and then a theme - specific animation.
